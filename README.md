# Multidimensional Modelling and Mining Data Cubes

A group project where we developed a comprehensive business intelligence (BI) solution for World Wide Importers, encompassing multidimensional modeling, data mining, and strategic recommendations. The project involved creating a multidimensional model for the WorldWideImportersDW data mart and designing data mining structures for the WWISales data mart to support effective decision-making.

Technologies Used:

    SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)

    Multidimensional Expressions (MDX)

    Data Mining Algorithms (Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Clustering, Association Rules)

    Power BI (for Pivot Table deployment and analysis)

Skills:

    Multidimensional Modeling: Designed and implemented a multidimensional model for the WorldWideImportersDW data mart, including dimensions, attributes, attribute relationships, hierarchies, a calculated member for profit margin, and a KPI for profit margin status.

    Data Mining: Created data mining structures for the WWISales data mart to predict households with no children, utilizing Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, Clustering, and Association Rules algorithms.

    Data Analysis: Evaluated the efficacy of data mining models in terms of predictive accuracy using lift charts and prediction join queries.

    Reporting and Visualization: Deployed the multidimensional model to Excel and created a pivot table to demonstrate the created elements.

    Strategic Recommendations: Assessed the data warehouse design strategies (Kimball vs. Inmon) and recommended the most appropriate approach for World Wide Importers, providing justifications based on the organization's requirements.
